## Research Profile

{% capture text %}

The Architectures for Reliable Image Analysis (ARIA) research group is part of the Signal Processing Systems group of Eindhoven University of Technology. Our research spans areas of video analysis, image/video segmentation, object-oriented and 3D video compression that underpin systems-oriented research on video coding and architectures.

We pursue state-of-the-art video functionality at high cost-efficiency (e.g. for real-time aspects and/or mobile applications), through a combination of novel algorithms and architectures.
