Francisco Caetano presented our work on **Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow)** at **AAAI 2026**.

SymmFlow offers a unified generative framework where **generation**, **segmentation**, and **classification** are treated within one coherent model.

AAAI provided a wonderful setting to exchange ideas with the broader AI community and shape the next steps of this line of research.

Congratulations to Francisco for representing the TUE ARIA group at AAAI 2026.
